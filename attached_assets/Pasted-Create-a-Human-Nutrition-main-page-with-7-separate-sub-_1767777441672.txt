🧱 CONTENT STRUCTURE (FOR EACH SUBTYPE PAGE)
1️⃣ The Need

Use this exact reference content:

India is the largest producer of milk in the world with 146.3 million tonnes of production and per capita availability of 322 GM/day.

Fortification of milk with Vitamin A and Vitamin D is required in India because of the widespread deficiencies present in the population. A National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) survey and a Report of the expert group of ICMR in 2012 stated that India has very high burden of Vitamin A and D deficiencies, amongst both young children and adults particularly in urban areas who are physically less active and have limited exposure to sunlight.

Since milk is consumed by all, its fortification with micronutrients is a good strategy to address micronutrient malnutrition. (FSSAI)
